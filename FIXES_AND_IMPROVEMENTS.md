# Fixes and Improvements Applied

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. **Session Initialization Logic Error** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** In `app.py` lines 45-48, there was a logical error:
```python
if "session_id" not in st.session_state:
    if "session_id" in st.session_state:  # This would never be True!
```

**Fix:**
- Simplified session initialization
- Removed the contradictory logic
- Session ID is now created once and persists during the session

```python
if "session_id" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    print(f"New session started: {st.session_state.session_id}")
```

---

### 2. **Session Cleanup Strategy Improved** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** The cleanup function tried to clean up "previous" session on initialization, which didn't make sense in Streamlit's architecture.

**Fix:**
- Renamed `cleanup_old_session()` → `cleanup_current_session()`
- Added "Reset" button to UI for manual cleanup
- Cleanup now properly deletes vectors from current namespace when user clicks Reset
- Clears both vector_db and rag_sources from session state

**New Function:**
```python
def cleanup_current_session():
    """Delete vectors from current session namespace in Pinecone"""
    try:
        if "session_id" in st.session_state and st.session_state.session_id:
            pc = get_pinecone_client()
            index_name = os.getenv("PINECONE_INDEX_NAME", "document-rag-vectors")
            index = pc.Index(index_name)

            current_namespace = f"session-{st.session_state.session_id}"
            index.delete(delete_all=True, namespace=current_namespace)

            # Clear session state
            if "vector_db" in st.session_state:
                del st.session_state.vector_db
            if "rag_sources" in st.session_state:
                st.session_state.rag_sources = []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during session cleanup: {e}")
```

### 3. **UI Enhancement - Added Reset Button** ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue:** Users had no way to clear documents and vectors without refreshing the browser.

**Fix:**
- Changed button layout from 2 columns to 3 columns
- Added "🗑️ Reset" button
- Clicking Reset:
  1. Deletes all vectors in current Pinecone namespace
  2. Clears vector_db from session state
  3. Clears rag_sources list
  4. Reruns the app to reflect changes

**New UI Layout:**
```python
cols0 = st.columns(3)
with cols0[0]:
    st.toggle("Use RAG", ...)
with cols0[1]:
    st.button("Clear Chat", ...)
with cols0[2]:
    st.button("🗑️ Reset", help="Clear all documents and vectors")
```

- ✅ Pinecone client
- ✅ LangChain Pinecone integration
- ✅ OpenAI embeddings

## How to Test the Application

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
cd "/Users/shubham/Code Block⚙️/AI_Apps/DOCUMENT_RAG_APP"
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 2: Test File Upload
1. Click "Browse files" in sidebar
2. Select a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file
3. Wait for success toast: "Document *filename* loaded successfully"
4. Check "Documents in DB" expander - should show 1 document

### Step 3: Test RAG Query
1. Ensure "Use RAG" toggle is ON (should auto-enable after upload)
2. Type a question about the document content
3. Press Enter
4. Response should start with "*(RAG Response)*"
5. Response should include information from your document

### Step 4: Test Reset Function
1. Click "🗑️ Reset" button
2. App should rerun
3. "Documents in DB" should show (0)
4. "Use RAG" toggle should be disabled
5. Upload a new document to verify clean state

### Step 5: Test Non-RAG Mode
1. Toggle "Use RAG" to OFF
2. Ask a general question
3. Response should NOT have "*(RAG Response)*" prefix
4. Response uses general knowledge only

## Known Limitations

1. **Session-Based Storage:** Vectors are deleted when you click Reset or when browser session ends (by design)
2. **Free Tier:** Pinecone free tier has limits (sufficient for this use case)
3. **Single User:** No multi-user authentication (can be added later)
4. **10 Document Limit:** Maximum 10 documents per session (configurable in `DB_DOCS_LIMIT`)
